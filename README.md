# Better Notepad
**Better Notepad** is a simple Notepad-like desktop application made with [**Qt 6**](https://www.qt.io/). In contrary to the integrated Notepad in Windows, a bunch of new features have been added for having the best desktop experience as possible while using this application, we would highlight the following features:
- Live font change preview
- Toolbars
- Modern theme
- Custom theme support

This software is **open-source**, meaning that everyone can contribute for making this project the best as possible.
