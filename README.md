# Better Notepad
**Better Notepad** is a simple Notepad-like desktop application. In contrary to the integrated Notepad in Windows, a bunch of new features have been added for having the best desktop experience as possible while using this application (some features are not added yet but will be later..)
- Live font change preview

This software is **open-source**, meaning that everyone can contribute for making this project the best as possible.
